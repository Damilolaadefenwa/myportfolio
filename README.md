# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio web app built with React, TypeScript, Vite and Tailwindcss. It demonstrates a collection of small projects and reusable UI components (product/project cards, image uploader, modals, and a spinner), plus a simple service in `services/geminiService.ts`. The code highlights TypeScript types, component composition, and basic client-side routing.

Key folders and files:
- `components/` — reusable UI components shown in the site
- `App.tsx`, `index.tsx` — application entry and routing
- `services/` — example data/service logic

Feel free to explore the source to see how components are composed and typed.
